Eunice was walking in the desert and got very thirsty. 
She did not drink any water for three days and felt like she was about to pass out. 
Just then, she saw a big boulder and ran towards it.
When she arrived in front of the rock, she realized the rock was magic and it started talking. 
'Please give me some water' she said. 
Water poured out of the rock and they Eunice became friends.
