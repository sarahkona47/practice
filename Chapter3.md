Eunice had finally had enough. She decided to turn into a rock. It was a strange looking thing, with weird sharp protrusions. A type of rock you would see in the Arizona desert and kick along the way. It was brown with speckles of black. Strangely enoughly the rock had retained Eunice's leg so she looked extremely strange. Looking like an alien, Eunice walked into town looking for the boulder she had fell in love with. When she finally arrived at the city center, she saw the boulder, and ran up to hug it. No surprise the boulder didn't move because it was a rock. Eunice being sad, stayed as a rock and decided to live on the mountain by herself.
